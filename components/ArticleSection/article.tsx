            Have you recently struggled with your design-development workflow?

            Looking for methods to drastically enhance it? So you'll need a

            transformation. But one that has recently sparked a lot of emotions
            and curiosity. The objective behind a full stack design system, also
            known as Atomic Design Methodology, Component Design, and Design
            Language, is to create a sequence of components that can be reused

          <h2>The Handover Concern</h2>
        </div>

        <div className={styles.articleSectionRight}>
          <p>
            Designers and developers used to encounter several challenges.
            Handoff presented several issues due to iterations, requirement
            changes, and the compartmentalised structure of design and
            development. It frequently resulted in designers impeding developers
            and bad product decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            By concentrating on regularly used components, designers and
            developers have been able to collaborate more effectively, and
            formerly isolated teams are now operating from the same mental
            model. Seeing current components saves a lot of time and work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The component-based design methodology is a significant advancement.
            It has decreased the requirement for handoffs dramatically.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Design System is a methodical approach to product creation that
            includes standards, principles, philosophies, and code. A design
            systems guide is an ideal tool for expanding the design practice,
            removing the need for hand-off, and promoting increased cooperation.

          <h2 className={styles.designSystem}>Why Should You Use a Design System?</h2>
          <h2 className={styles.designSystemMobile}>The Handover Concern</h2>
        </div>

        <div className={styles.articleSectionRight}>
          <p>
            A Design System has several advantages. It enables the entire firm
            to provide better and more consistent design solutions more
            effectively. It makes it easier to create engaging experiences for
            end users.
          </p>
          <h4>1. Promotes Consistency</h4>
          <p>
            Building a Design System begins with categorizing all of a product's
            visual components. This assists in identifying the most significant
            discrepancies within the product and assists the team in determining
            the product's relevant and most often utilized features and
            components. The most important Design Principle is consistency.
          </p>
          <h4>1. Better Communication</h4>
          <p>
            Open-source Design Systems are frequently referred to be the single
            source of truth for product development teams. It assists the team
            in planning, developing, and maintaining product quality. <br />
            <br />
            Single source of truth (SSOT) is a notion that organisations employ
            as part of their information architecture to ensure that everyone
            makes business choices using the same facts.
            <br />
            <br />
            Because it is a single source of truth, it encompasses any
            vocabulary that may be utilized in the project. Gone are the days
            when a developer would refer to a button as the red one. This
            improves talks between developers and designers by allowing them to
            use the same naming standard.
          </p>
          <h4>2. Clarification for Developers</h4>
          <p>
            Developers have a clear view of how to construct the needed
            components while keeping the unified styles when it is in place.
          </p>
          <h4>3. Iterate Faster</h4>
          <p>
            By using a Design System, teams may iterate much more quickly. You
            may deploy new ideas in tiny pieces with fewer resources and shorter
            feedback cycles. It keeps you organized and up to speed on all of
            your team's design updates.
          </p>
          <h4>4. Improved Customer Service</h4>
          <p>
            The cognitive burden is lowered when transitioning from a mobile app
            experience to a desktop browser experience produced with it. A
            better experience for customers who use your goods may be produced
            by developing a consistent language that both internal and external
            users can comprehend.
          </p>
          <h4>5. Making use of each other's efforts</h4>
          <p>
            Because Design Systems may be used across different teams,
            efficiency can be extended across teams and products. It is now
            simple to harness other people's work and utilise each other's
            creativity without recreating the wheel.
            <br />
            <br />
            The key advantages of utilizing and maintaining a Design System are
            operating at scale and enhancing efficiency and consistency. Because
            you reuse components in a Design System, the time and effort
            invested in developing one pay off in the long term. Your design and
            development team can simply improve existing goods, improve the user
            experience, or focus on developing new items.
            <br />
            <br />
            A Design System is frequently used interchangeably with a Style
            Guide or a Component Library. These, however, are sub-components of
            a Design System.
            <br />
            <br />
            A Design System is significantly more sophisticated than
            conventional style guides. Everything from colours to documentation
            is included. A Design System essentially creates a consistent visual
            language for product teams.
            <br />
            <br />
            It expedites the design process and bridges the gap between the
            teams engaged in creating a final product by establishing common
            aesthetic standards, making it extremely simple to design websites
            from components. It functions as a rulebook for the design and
            development teams and is divided into the following sections:
          </p>
          <h4>Design System</h4>
          <p>
            The whole collection of design standards, including principles,
            patterns, and components for achieving them.
          </p>
          <h4>Pattern Library</h4>
          <p>
            A pattern library is a collection of reusable components and user
            interface design elements. It is a sub-component of the Design
            System. A pattern library is essentially a collection of design
            components that appear several times on a website.
          </p>
          <h4>Style Guide</h4>
          <p>
            A Style Guide is another sub-component that emphasizes visual
            presentation and dictates how things should appear. Colours,
            typefaces, brand features, and logos are all part of it.

            Rather than rethinking the basis of each new experience for your
            goods, a Design System keeps designers, developers, product
            managers, and various stakeholders aligned with the company's design
            goal and allows the team to effortlessly focus on pixel-perfect
            production.
